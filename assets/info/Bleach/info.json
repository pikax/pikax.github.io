While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family, but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits, and along with Rukia, who is slowly regaining her powers, it's Ichigo's job to both protect the innocent from Hollows and to help the spirits themselves find peace. Won the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category.============Notice================DO NOT UPLOADWe've been requested to stop hosting this series by Viz.==========Notice End==============","status":"Ongoing","type":"Manga","mature":false,"chapters":[]}
